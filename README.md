# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This is a webpage dedicated the prework study before commencing the coding bootcamp.

The motivation behind this project was to be able to have an easy and accessible resource to house important and regualarly need information.

I built this webpage because I wanted somewhere easy that I could reference, and keep updated with knowledge about coding that I can draw upon throughout the duration of the coding bootcamp. Rather than having pages of notes on various topics and tips, and printing off pages, finding the right one when needed, it is much more efficient to house everything on one webpage that I can access and navigate quickly and easily.

One major problem I face in this project was my HTML file randomly dissapearing throughout the process. In fact 6 times. Each time I went back to stage one, deleted my repo and all files on my local drive, and started again. Whilst very frustrating, I did find that repeating this process over and over really cemented the processes and language (git language) into my memory.

The reason why this kept happening was due to a double up of folders on my local drive called 'prework-study-guide.' The one that I created in the Bootcamp directory and the 2nd from the folder downloaded and unzipped from the module. Even though both of these folders were in different directories, somehow (although I don't quite understand how) it confused the index.HTML file and changed them between directories. Once I deleted the downloaded zip folder I didn't encounter this problem again.
